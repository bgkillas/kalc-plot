# kalc-plot

a [rupl](https://github.com/bgkillas/rupl) implementation using
[kalc-lib](https://github.com/bgkillas/kalc-lib) to calculate data points, expected to be used in
[kalc](https://github.com/bgkillas/kalc)

### usage
last arg will be the functions to be ran in format of kalc

### features
specifying skia in Cargo.toml instead of egui
will make a more minimal backend which is faster but less portable
